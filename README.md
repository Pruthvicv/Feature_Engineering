"Predict house prices via feature engineering &amp; EDA. Analyze influential factors in Ames, Iowa dataset. Build predictive insights for property buyers. Transparent code for reproducibility."

This GitHub repository contains code and documentation for a predictive modeling project focused on understanding the factors influencing house prices during property purchase. The project involves comprehensive feature engineering and exploratory data analysis on a dataset from Ames, Iowa. The dataset includes a diverse set of attributes related to residential properties.

Key Steps:
Dataset understanding: Explore shape, null values, and unique values.
Separate datasets: Create numerical and categorical subsets for analysis.
EDA of numerical variables: Handle missing values, assess distribution, and identify correlations.
EDA of categorical variables: Address missing values, visualize relationships, and calculate significance.
Combine significant variables: Merge impactful numerical and categorical attributes.
Outlier detection: Use box plots to find outliers and refine the dataset for modeling.
The project's objective is to gain insights into the features that impact house prices, providing a foundation for building predictive models. Through this repository, we offer transparent and reproducible code, facilitating further analysis and model development.
